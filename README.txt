Thank you for downloading! To install, drag both .wotmod files from the option folder(s) of your choice to <Your WoT Directory\mods\<Game Version>

(Example: C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\mods\1.18.0.1)




====OPTIONAL (compatibility with Classic's/Zorgane's HRMODv3 Gun Sounds):====

In case you run my HRMODv3 Gun Sounds, I have included an add-on to change the firing/reload sounds of the gun to match the model (20 pdr). To install, drag the "mods" folder from within <the vehicle folder(s) of your choosing>\"OPTIONAL - 20 pdr gun sound"\ to <Your WoT Directory> and merge with existing folders.

(Example: C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\)
